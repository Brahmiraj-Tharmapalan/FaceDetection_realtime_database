# FaceDetection_realtime_database
This project is a real-time attendance system with a real-time database.
In this project, the uploaded pictures are changed into encoded files using the Encoding Generator, and then the main file will access the camera and take every frame, check the encoded file, find the accurate face, and put it in the database and display it.
